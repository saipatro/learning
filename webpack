Webpack concepts

-----------------------

1. Babel support
Babel is a popular transpiler which is there to help us with transpiling ES6 features down to ES5. We will need the following packages to enable babel working with webpack:

@babel/core
@babel/plugin-syntax-dynamic-import
@babel/preset-env
babel-core
babel-loader
babel-preset-env

-----------------------

2. SASS & CSS Support

For setting up SASS and CSS you need the following packages:

sass-loader
css-loader
style-loader
MiniCssExtractPlugin

------------------------

3. Custom Development & Production Setup

Here are the packages that will get used:

clean-webpack-plugin: For cleanup of the dist folder contents.
compression-webpack-plugin: For gzipping the dist folder file contents.
copy-webpack-plugin: For copying static assets, files or resources from application source to dist folder.
html-webpack-plugin: For creating an index.html file in the dist folder.
